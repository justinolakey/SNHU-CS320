**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
The main tool we have developed in this course is how to use unit tests. Unit tests are a powerful tool to check that your code functions as expected at a granular level. Each piece of code, such as class, methods, or interfaces, should have unit tests developed. These provide a quick way to ensure the code meets requirements. At higher levels, integration and system tests need to be developed to test the interfunctionality of your code. In conjunction with testing functionality, developers should run their code through static and dynamic security testing. There are multiple static test methods that are easy to use and integrate into a CI/CD process. Dynamic testing needs to be developed specifically for the project, though there are many useful resources and guidelines to help develop dynamic tests.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
There are many ways to collect user needs and transform them into requirements. Many professional projects will have formal processes to create and document requirements. Smaller, less formal projects can gather user needs from various sources such as reviews, industry standards, or even directly from the users through feedback forms and surveys. Once the requirements are identified, then the functions should be implemented and tests developed to ensure the code meets the user needs.

**How do I approach designing software?**
In a professional environment, requirements are very formal and structured. Many of the requirements have been implemented on previous projects. In that case I can research what was previously developed and integrate into the new project. If there are brand new requirements then I will often seek out senior developers to get their input on the design.

On a personal project, I enjoy the process of implementation and modular development. There is a function I want to add to my project. I research online possible designs. I try to implement it and test it. Usually this process cycles through many times to implement simple functionality, but at this point in my career I am more invested in learning to design and develop. I am not trying to be quick or efficient.
